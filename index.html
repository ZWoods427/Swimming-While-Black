				<p>Learning how to swim has many benefits for people of all ages. 
				The ability to safely enjoy water activities in the summer, physical fitness 
				and stress relief are just a few examples of why many people take up the hobby. 
				According to Stop Drowning Now roughly 3,400 people drown each year with drowning being the 
				leading cause of deaths for children between the ages of one and four. Of those fatalities, 
				sixty-four percent of Black children have little to no swimming skills compared to forty-five percent 
				of Hispanic/Latino and forty percent of caucasian children. The solution to this issue is to teach 
				children and adults how to swim. </p>

				<p>There is a long standing stereotype that Black Americans do not know or are unable to learn how to swim. 
					This assumption has existed for many decades with most people of all races believing it to be true. 
					And while the statistics validate this assumption, the reasons for the high percentage are deeply rooted 
					in this country’s history of segregation and racism. We will take a closer look at the history of America’s 
					swimming pools and the progress made towards bridging the swimming gap.</p>

					<h3>Segregation and Swimming</h3>
					<img src="images/no swimming.svg">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> In the 1920s shortly after the great depression 1,000 pools were built in urban areas after the public 
						demanded more forms of recreational activities for their communities. 
						The pools were funded by The Public Works Administration and Works Progress Administration, an agency of 
						the Federal American New Deal program. Most of these pools were built outside of neighborhoods that had a 
						majority Black population and the few pools that were built in these neighborhoods were often kept in 
						toxic and hazardous conditions that made the pools unswimmable. To keep their pools segregated, white residents promoted false
						narratives of Black people as sexual deviants and uncontrollable around white women in swimsuits, violent and carried diseases 
						that can be transmitted in the water. Over time as more Black southerners migrated to the north and Mid-West states, many of the public pools 
						closed down as a result of the “White flight” (White residents fled to the suburbs as more Black southerners 
						moved to the urban areas of northern states) of the 1950s and 1960s leaving non-White residents with little or no access to swimming resources.

		<h3>The Fight to Swim</h3>
					<img src="images/community.svg">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 desegregated public spaces 
						including beaches and swimming pools, signs that once read “whites only” were reworded to read “members only” and 
						pool owners began charging high entry fees as a way to comply with the new law and still keep their pools segregated. People of all races 
						began protesting the owner's refusal to integrate with “swim ins” (pool version of sit ins) and white owners fought back with hazardous tactics including 
						tossing nails at the bottom of their pools. One of the more memorable swim-ins took place in 1964 in St. Augustine Florida. At the Monson Motor Lodge 
						protestors refused to leave the motel's pool at the insistance of motel manager James Brock. Brock called the police but when protestors refused to leave
						the water, Brock grabbed a bottle of muriatic acid and poured it into the motel’s pool as members of the media and the public looked on in horror.

					<h3>The Future of Swimming in the Black Community</h3>
					<img src="images/fortune teller.svg">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Decades later, the number of leisure and competitive Black swimmers have slowly risen
						from the ashes of the fires of the civil rights movement. At the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics, Enith Brigitha
						won two bronze medal in the women's 100m and 200m freestyle representing the Netherlands making her the first Black athlete to win an Olympic medal in swimming. 
						Fourty years later Simone Manuel became the first Black American woman to win an individual Olympic gold medal in swimming for the 100m freestyle at
						the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. She tied with Penny Oleksiak of Canada for first place. Manuel also won gold in Rio in the 4x100m medley and took 
						home silver in the 50m freestyle and the 4x100-meter freestyle relay. 
						Black competitive swim teams have also made homes for themselves in the sport. The Theresa Banks swim club in Prince George's County Maryland,
						The Mahogany Mermaids of Charlotte, NC and the Howard University swimming and diving team (the only HBCU swim and diving team in the country)
						are just a few of those teams. But there is no team if there is no access to lessons. Organizations like Black People Will Swim in Hempstead, NY and 
						Tank Proof located in Austin, TX is doing their part to provide access to swim lessons in the Black community.
